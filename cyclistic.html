									<h1>Data Analytics <br> Case Study</h1>
									<p><u><b>Introduction:</b></u> This case study is based on data from a Chicago based bikeshare company named Cyclistic.  
										This study follows the six data analysis steps: <b>ask, prepare, process, analyze, visualize, act</b>.
									The raw data can be found here and the post-analysis excel spreasheet can be found here.<br /></p>

									</header>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="" /></div>

									<p><u><b>1: Ask</b></u> <br> Cyclistic has casual riders that pay a fee for each ride in addition to members 
										who pay an annual fee for unlimited rides. The question for this analysis is <b>how do annual 
										members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently</b>? This question's answer can be 
										used to encourage more casual riders to switch to annual members and generate more revenue.</p>

									

									<p><u><b>2: Prepare</b></u> <br>The data to be analyzed is from .csv file that contains data for Cyclistic trips 
										for January 2022. This is first party source since it comes from directly from Cyclistic. It is a comprehensive list 
										all 103,770 trips for the month of January.  To prepare the data for analysis, I converted the file to a .xlsx file.   </p>

										
								
									<p><u><b>3: Process</b></u> <br>I created column E called "ride_length" by subtracting the start time from end time and changing to the 
										time format. I also created column F called "day_of_week" using the TEXT function on the "started_at" column. I cleaned the data by 
										filtering it to just include rows with rides that lasted 0 or less minutes and deleting them.  </p>

									<figure>
										<img src="images/process.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
										<figcaption><center>Snapshots of the columns I added.</center></figcaption>
									</figure>

									<p><br></p>

									<p><u><b>4: Analyze</b></u> <br>I created the following pivot tables to aggregate the data:</p>
									
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Analyze_1.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
										<figcaption><center>This pivot table lists the number of rides that occured on each day of the week according to 
											member type. It also displays the percentage of rides that were member or casual occuring on each day of the week.  </center></figcaption>
									</figure>

									<p><br></p>
									
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Analyze_2.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
										<figcaption><center>This pivot table lists the average ride lengths in minutes during each day of the week according to memeber type. </center></figcaption>
									</figure>

									<p><br></p>

									<p><u><b>5: Share</b></u> <br>I created graphs from the pivot tables in order to gain insights from the data:</p>

									
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Share_1.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
										<figcaption><center>The number of casual rides is similar for every weekday except for a spike on Saturday. This could be 
											because most people have more free time to ride casually on Saturdays. Members have the opposite outcome of 
											riding more on weekdays than weekends. This may be because they use bikes to get to work or events that regularly 
											happen on weekdays.  In addition, members ride much more often than casual users. This can be because members pay a 
											flat fee for the month while casuals have to pay every time they ride.</center></figcaption>
									</figure>


									<p><br></p>
									
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Share_2.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
										<figcaption><center>Out of all riders, a greater percentage of casual riders ride on Sunday and Saturday. Members tend 
											to have a higher percentage during the weekdays than weekends. Just like the first graph, this can be because 
											members use bikes to get to work or events that regularly happen on weekdays. </figcaption>
									</figure>
										
									<p><br></p>

									<figure>
										<img src="images/Share_3.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
										<figcaption><center>Casual riders tend to ride for twice to three times as long as members. This may be because casual riders have to 
											pay for each ride and want to make the most of it by riding longer while member tend to ride more times for less 
											time each ride. Casual times also vary much more depending on the day of the week than members. This can be due to 
											members having consistent routes that they ride often.</figcaption>
									</figure>
										
									<p><br></p>

									<p><u><b>6: Act</b></u> <br>The top three recommendations based on my analysis:
										<ol>
											<li>Advertise memberships as an inexpensive way to get to work.</li>
											<li>Offer cheaper membership that only allow the customer to ride on the weekends. This targets the relatively 
												large amount of casual rides that ride on weekends.  </li>
											<li>Change the casual ride to cost per minute of riding. This insentivises people to get a membership if they 
												would like to ride for a longer time without penalty.</li>
										  </ol>
